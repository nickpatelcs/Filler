# Filler
Implementation of the GamePigeon Game: Filler, in Python.

This program is a Python implementation of a turn-based game where players compete to control the most squares on a game board. It uses the cmu_graphics library and defines a Player class with attributes for the player's name, controlled squares, and score. The program initializes the game board by assigning unique colors to each square, and players take turns selecting squares to gain control over them. It was created as a creative task for the CMU 15-112 course. It is based off the IOS GamePigeon game: Filler. 

## CMU Graphics

CMU Graphics is a persistent-object graphics package geared towards beginner computer science students. CMU Graphics and its desktop version are maintained by [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/), a Carnegie Mellon University project which develops free-to-use middle and high school computer science curriculum.


From there, the syntax for using the graphics package is identical to the browser-based version of the framework. You can find more details about how to use the graphics framework here on our [documentation page](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs).
